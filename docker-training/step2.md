## Containers

A container is a running image instance. In docker each container usually runs a single process.

For this step we have a running **busybox** container executing ping in background.

In order to list containers we will use `docker ps`{{execute}} for active containers.
Or `docker ps -a`{{execute}} to show all containers.

## Images

In order to list images we use `docker images`{{execute}}
